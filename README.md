# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to determine how school size, budgets, and types impacted overall student learning and passing percentages. In addition to analyzing how schools performed based off of those three criterias, the analysis also focused on what the impact would be on removing data on the disqualified students from Thomas High School. 

## Results
The impact of removing the disqualified Freshman students from Thomas High School had very minimal impact on the overall results of this analysis. It is more probable than not, that the overall impact is statistically insignifcant and within the standard margin of error when making inferences based off the sample schools in this analysis.
